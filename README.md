In this notebook we analyzed 768 patients data and tried to predict diabetes or not. We used numpy,pandas and SkLearn libraries for our analyses. 
The notebook included detailed Data cleaning, EDA, Machine Learning model comparison  tuning of the best model.
The analysis resulted that, logistics Regression model resulted the best prediction for diabetes because it was given better accuracy and better recall(in confussion matrix) compared to other algorithm. We can improve the accuracy by using tuning parameter
which is supported for logistic regression algorithm.
We can also improve the accuracy by getting more data or
else by cleaning the data more carefully.
